# C++ Module 03: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

This is a 42 school project. This module focuses on virtual functions, deep copying, abstract classes, and interface classes.

Concepts learned and applied:
- Exercise 00: Polymorphism
  - Learning virtual functions and override
- Exercise 01: I don’t want to set the world on fire
  - Dynamic memory management in constructors and destructors
  - Virtual destructors
  - Deep copy vs shallow copy
- Exercise 02: Abstract class
  - Pure virtual functions
  - Abstract classes that cannot be instantiated
- Exercise 03: Interface & recap
  - Interface classes
  - Circular‐include
  - Memory management with classes
  - Rigorous testing
